Create Instructional Support Persona based on EK & JM in pattern exersise.

Create "bullet point" persona based on the pattern exercise completed.  These should be rough.  They need a name, a tag line, bullets of demographics, characteristics and goals.  We'll do another iteration before the release if we have time.

A persona is created from the following participants we talked to.

Personas identified:\
Faculty\
1 ) MD & SV (Faculty / Department Head or Manager)\
2\) SB, RW, JA (Tenured / Tenured track faculty)\
3\) SV & MB (Instructor / Tenured track)\
4\) WW, PC (GSI / TA)\
5\) TA1 (GSI / TA)\
6\) Need a provisional for a tenured faculty that isn't so much into all this new technology.

Student\
1\) TT, CY (undergrad & sciences)\
2\) WW & ME (grad student)\
3\) NL, MD, AC (undergrad / various)\
4\) Need a provisional for a semi-slacker student

Instructional Support Staff\
1\) EK & JM (Administrative support)\
2\) M (technology in pedagogy)
