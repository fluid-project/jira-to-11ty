A page contains entries such as notes, preference changes, goals, etc.

A page is organized as follows (roughly):

* Date of Page at top
* event stream of interactions with the journal for that day
* "How do I feel right now?" prompt
* "What do I want to achieve today?" prompt
* "Anything else I'd like to note today" prompt
* navigational controls
