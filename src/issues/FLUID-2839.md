I tabbed through the easier to see settings and then from the last setting, Simplified Layout, tab takes me into the preview window.  Once I tab through it and the reset/save/cancel buttons I'm taken back to the browser.  UI Options stays open and there doesn't seem to be anyway to get back to it by tabbing.  I can't even get back into the My Dashboard page.  I just keep cycling through the browser tabbable fields.
