Assuming the registration form can be expanded to handle additional Business User metadata (see IDI-157), the registration form should be open to the public so that any business can register.

The registration form should be styled and integrated into the front end and be part of the business user workflow.

**Estimate: 2d**

* CSS work
* adding navigation elements.
* Verify that workflow works
