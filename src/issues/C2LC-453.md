I was reviewing <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/C2LC-447#icft=C2LC-447> and noticed the character could end up behind the scene controls when moving to the lower right corner.  I double-checked, this is also true of develop-0.9 and the live site, so I'm filing it as a new ticket.

@@Daniel Cho, not sure about your work on the new backgrounds, but I thought I'd mention this to you so that you could either confirm that it's fixed in the new work or talk it through with Sepi.
