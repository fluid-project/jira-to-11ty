The menu button does not behave as you would expect when using it with the keyboard. Pressing enter when on the button shows the menu but nothing is highlighted. Once the menu is showing the down arrow does not do anything but the up arrow will allow you to cycle through the options in the menu.&#x20;

Check in with the designers for how the button should behave with the keyboard.
