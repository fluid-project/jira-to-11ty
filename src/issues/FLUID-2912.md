Starting mobile FSS development in preparation for the all-hands fluid meeting, where we hope to have examples for the following:

1\) markup parsed and delivered to multiple destinations ("tagging" markup semantically/for layout so that relevant experiences can be derived from one html page)

2\) markup templates and mobile stylesheets for components (Artifact, others?)

3\) markup for a mobile experience from scratch

***

Scenarios:

A) Simple. \
Provide iPhone-like UIs for path to artifact component, possibly rolling in styles from an existing framework into mFSS. Artifact component also styled with mFSS.

B) Fantasy?\
Start with a complex website and pare down to something like Clayton's example via semantic tagging of markup.
