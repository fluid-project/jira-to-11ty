It contains 4 files:\n\n* `.npmignore`\n* `HALasm.js.mem`: WebAssembly blob\n* `package.json`\n* `wonder.min.js`: the minified library\n\nSo, the library is not 'open source': binary blob + minified library, with no source code.\n\nIt looks like there is a good chance that `HALasm.js.mem` has been generated by [emscripten](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten). The `wonder.min.js` file contains the following string from Emscripten `parseTools.js`:\n\n* <https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/afeebd2b3bf09e313247ba25fc0e821cfc079243/src/parseTools.js#L1324>\n"

Wonder Workshop have created a library for using their robots from browser JavaScript:

* <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wonderworkshop/wwjs>
* <https://github.com/playi/wwjs-examples>

Some initial notes, questions, and things to look into:

* The page on NPM for the `@wonderworkshop/wwjs` package (<https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wonderworkshop/wwjs>) lists <https://github.com/playi/wwjs-examples> as the package repository. However, that repository does not contain the library, but rather it contains documentation for the library and examples for using it.
* It looks like the source code for the library itself is not public
* When we do an `npm install` to download the `wwjs` package, what does the code downloaded look like?
  * Is it pure JavaScript?
  * Does it contain any binary blobs?
* The NPM page for the library lists the license as CC-BY-NC-4.0
  * Is the code that is installed at `npm install` clearly licensed by that license? What is covered by this license?
  * What impact does using this license for the library have on our code? Is it viral?

Let's start by doing a technical exploration replacing our existing DashDriver.js with one using this Wonder Workshop library.
