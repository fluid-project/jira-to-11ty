We are currently bloating our code with changing classes based on the focused state of elements instead of using the focus pseudo selector. Unfortunately IE6 does not support the focus pseudo selector and given that focus styling is required for keyboard accessibility we do need an alternative.&#x20;

Let's see if <http://selectivizr.com/> would fill the gap. Alternatively, we could put in some code that does some heavy handed focus styling when we are in IE6.&#x20;
