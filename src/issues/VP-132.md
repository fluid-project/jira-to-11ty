If text other than the first string of text in the transcript has been previously highlighted in the transcript, tab focusing the transcript will place a faint dotted outline around the first focusable string element and scroll the element into view.

To reproduce:

* Show transcripts
* Select a piece of text further down the transcript
* tab all the way around until transcript has focus again
* the dotted focus outline should appear around the first element and the container should scroll up to put it into view.
