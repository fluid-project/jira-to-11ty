When navigating to/between the text input character position controls in most browsers (including desktop Safari), the existing value is highlighted, and the user just has to type the new desired value.  In iOS Safari, the cursor is positioned after the existing value, and the user must hit backspace to clear out the existing value.  This seems to be a “feature” of iOS Safari:

Potential solution/option: instead of text input boxes, use \<select> elements, one for column, and one for row. This should result in a UI better optimized for the iPad. We would need to test across browsers to see how the control is presented.
