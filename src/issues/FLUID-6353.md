Additional contrast themes were added as part of work done for FLUID-6297 and FLUID-6298. Those should be documented in the [Working with User Interface Options](https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/tutorial-userInterfaceOptions/WorkingWithUserInterfaceOptions.html#contrast-themes) and [Using Images in Contrast Modes](https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/tutorial-userInterfaceOptions/UsingImagesInContrastModes.html#converting-images-with-transparency) pages.
