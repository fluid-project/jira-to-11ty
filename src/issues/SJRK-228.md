Both [the server](https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling-server/pull/14) and [the client](https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/16) pull requests have been merged into "stories-floe-dev" branch, without having code review comments addressed, so that workshops next week can make use of this important feature. These review comments will be addressed when @@Gregor Moss comes back from vacation.
