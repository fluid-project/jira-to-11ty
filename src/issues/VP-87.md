Even with medialement.js in place, captions do not work in IE8. When Captionator is forced to instantiate (despite the face that it's not an HTML5 browser), you get an error that states "HTMLVideoElement is undefined. It seems that mediaelement.js fills in the MediaElement, but not HTMLVideoElement...
