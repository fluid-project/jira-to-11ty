A mood note can:

* record a mood at the time ("I feel good!")
* record a later annotation or commentary on the mood ("I felt good because I slept a full ten hours!")
* allow the user to edit either the mood, the annotation, or delete note entirely
* user can enter one mood per "session" (inputs should disappear until reload)
