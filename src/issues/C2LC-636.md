Example program: <https://develop-1-2--c2lc-build.netlify.app/?v=1.2&t=default&w=Sketchpad&p=sA1s1z&c=aab&d=>

 

\[startLoop A], \[Forward 1], \[endLoop A]

 

“Forward 1” block within the loop has label: “forward 1 square, position 1 of Loop A”

 

Currently the add node following the forward 1 block has label: “Add selected action forward 2 squares between position 2, forward 1 square and position 3, end of loop A”

 

 

Ideally we'd have:

* “Add selected action forward 2 squares to the beginning of loop A”
* “Add selected action forward 2 squares to the end of of loop A”
* “Add selected action forward 2 squares between position 1 of Loop A, forward 1 square and position 2 of Loop A, turn left 45 degrees”
