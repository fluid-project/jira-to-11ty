E.g. should OER Commons (for example) be able to choose different keys that the arrow keys for volume, for example?\n"

When videoPlayer has a focus:

* Up/Down keys should control video's sound

- Left/Right keys should control scrubber

* Enter/Space should Play/Pause the video

When sound controls container has a focus

* Up/Down keys should control video's sound

- Enter/Space should Mute/Unmute sound

When user selects and clicks on one of the language options in the Caption/Transcript menus the menu should hide and a focus should get back to the Caption/Transcript button depending on which menu was open.
