How to replicate a bug:

* Go to the page <http://build.fluidproject.org/videodemo/videoPlayer/demos/Mammals.html>
* Start any of the video and see that the captions are ON even though they should not.

Now

* Open a Firebug and in a Script tab select VideoPlayer\_html5Captionator.js file.
* Put a breakpoint on line 114. This a line where the component will decide to set the default attribute tag for the \<track> which would define if tracks should be shown by default based on the displayCaptions boolean in the model.&#x20;
* The page will break 3 times since there are 3 videos and the variable is set properly to false.&#x20;
* Now right any of the videos and see that captions are turned OFF.
