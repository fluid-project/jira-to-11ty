The two events seem to only be fired when the 'durationchange' event is fired, which as far as I can tell only happens on load. Our code updates both start and end time on durationchange. I can't see any reason from the code why startTime should be bound to updateMax.\n\nI've also tested the code without the extra listener (IE9 and FF on mac), and it seems to have no effect: all tests still pass, and the behaviour seems identical.\n"

On line 224 we are binding starttime with two different and opposite sounding functions. Let's take a closer look at this to see if it's reasonable.&#x20;
