We will need to implement aria-disabled checking in our button click handler as the button will remain operational (the HTML button element is no longer actually disabled).\n"

Steps to reproduce:

* Load the Coding Environment
* Connect to Dash
* Add a command step to the program
* Navigate by keyboard to the Run button
* Activate the Run button by pressing Space or Enter

Expected: Focus to remain on the Run button

Actual:

* Focus is lost
* This causes NVDA to say “Unavailable” when Run is activated

Notes:

* This happens because we are disabling the Run button when the program runs, and disabled controls in HTML cannot have focus
* An alternative would be to change the Run button into a Run/Pause or Run/Stop toggle button, rather than disabling it
