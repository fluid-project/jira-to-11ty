I'll talk to the team about making this change.\\\n\\[12:26] \\<scott\\_gonzalez> alexn: We're going to make the change.\n"

      "body": "Fix resides in the latest trunk of JQuery UI. See above ticket for this\n\nSince the fix is not even a part of JQuery UI 1.9 RC the only one way to update it so far is to backport it. \\\nYou will find that \\_on method is missing from the widget prototype if you copy tooltip code into the currently used Infusion. But after adding this missing \\_on() function the layout of the videoPlayer is broken. No idea why and what causes it.\n\nEven if the fix for the tooltip will get to the JQuery UI 1.9RC updating currently used JQuery UI in Infusion will require lots of testing and may cause changes/broken code in many many places.&#x20;\n"
