Then publish to the OSDPL. The wiki working page for this document is located here: <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/How+to+Create+a+Good+Design+Pattern>. This is likely to be a shared task.

An extract in Q\&A form is at <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Writing+a+Design+Pattern+--+FAQ>

Plan:\
1\. Jonathan and Paul create first draft of document.\
2\. Draft sent to list for feedback.\
3\. Draft finalized and published on OSDPL.
