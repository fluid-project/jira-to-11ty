When the control panel is opened for a block within a loop containing only that block, and the add-nodes are collapsed, then the control panel is rendered under (z-axis) the end loop block.

<!-- media: file 39a1611e-9e7f-4c37-8e39-37aea00dd68a -->

&#x20;

Tasks:

* Leave the positioning of the control panel as is
* Ensure that it is rendered on top of (z-axis) program blocks (such as the loop end block)
* Ensure that there is a black outline on the control panel in High Contrast theme
