In the Instructions section of the Uploader demo portal, there is a link to the Uploader Readme file. It currently points to\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/components/uploader/readme.txt>\
which doesn't work. It should point to\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/components/uploader/ReadMe.txt>
