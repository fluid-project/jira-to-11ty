Captions in the video player are displayed on top of the video. The background is generally transparent which allows the viewer to see the entire video beneath the captions. When a user selects a UIO theme, the background becomes opaque. This is probably what they require in order to read the text in the caption, however, it means that they lose the section of the video that is beneath the caption.&#x20;
