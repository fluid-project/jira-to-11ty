There is a new utility class \"XMLUtil\" which now does the work of flattening out \"Eighteen IDs\" into an XML-compatible form with very little bit-loss... this utility is now in RSF trunk also and when the next RSF release appears we can remove the copy of the utility I placed in Gallery.\n"

The ids of, for example, the thumbnail divs as generated by RSF include a unique string (a UUID?).  This string occurs right after the 'page-replace:' prefix, and before the "gallery: ..." (in the case of the lightbox template).  Sometimes, and it is rare, this unique string contains an open parenthesis, '('.  If it does, it causes the javascript function fluid.Utilities.seekNodesById() to fail with a syntax error, along the lines of "unmatched parenthesis".

My guess is that the parenthesis must be escaped in order to be seen as literal.  But, it would be better if they just didn't occur.  According to W3C, html 4.01 id's don't contain parentheses:\
