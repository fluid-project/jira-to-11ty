What are people coming to the component pages looking for?\n\nDaphne suggested that Jonathan and Erin might have been putting some thought and effort into this area.  I will plan on connecting with them before getting to far into restructuring the Layout Customizer component pages.\n"

Based on the conversation between Gary, Erin and Daphne we want to restructure the layout customizer design page and start to think about how it interacts with the new user testing page structure.
