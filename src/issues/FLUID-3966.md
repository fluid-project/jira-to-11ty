Neither via the mouse nor the keyboard are you able to open the easier to find panel

Steps to reproduce:

1\) Open the ui options demo\
<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/integration-demos/sakai/html/ui-options-fss-sakai.html>

2\) bring up the ui options controls

3\) Attempt to open the easier to find panel, notice that it doesn't open.
