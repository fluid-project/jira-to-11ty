We are currently using the React Bootstrap `Button` component within the coding environment but it is causing us more trouble than it is providing value. We are often fighting with the Bootstrap styles and in order to get the styling that we want, we need to make highly-specific CSS rules, with many selectors to override the Bootstrap styles.

We have an existing custom button component that wraps the Bootstrap one, `AriaDisablingButton` which would provide a good starting point.
