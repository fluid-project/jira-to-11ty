The Infusion build currently used by the Video Player includes many things that may not actually be required for the Video Player itself, such as uiOptions (required for demos, but VP should be able to work without it), Progress :question:, etc.

We want to ensure that the Video Player will work in any integration, whether UIO is there or not.

We also want to document just what the minimal requirements for an Infusion build are for the Video Player, just in case someone is integrating it into a site that already has Infusion.
