      "body": "One of our GSOC students found this while working towards integrating the VideoPlayer into ATutor: In his test setup, the template HTML folder was at the same level as the PHP file instantiating the VP, but the built-in path the VP template is \"../html/videoPlayer\\_template.html.\" Overriding that path specifically loaded the main template, but the language menu template still didn't load. Obviously, integrators could individually override each template path, but they shouldn't have to.\n"

The video player would be responsible for distributing this option to whoever needs it.\n"

Currently, the paths to the various templates used by the video player are hard coded in the various subcomponent options, and assume that the integration is at a certain relative path (not coincidentally, the same relativity as our demos). This causes problems if the integrator happens to be placing the videoPlayer code somewhere else, relatively.

We should implement an integrator path prefix option to address this.
