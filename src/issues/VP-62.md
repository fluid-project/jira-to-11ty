When the VideoPlayer initializes, it tries to pre-load the 'default' caption and transcript files. If UIO does not declare which the defaults are, the English ones are pre-loaded, but if UIO specifies a choice, the VideoPlayer should pre-load whatever language is requested. So if the user chooses "French" as their preferred language in the UIO "Audio+Video" panel, the videoPlayer should pre-load the french captions and transcripts.

To reproduce:\
1\) Modify VideoPlayer.html so that the URL to the English captions is bad and will cause an error (e.g. set 'src' to "bad.english.caption" or something).\
2\) Use UIO to set the preferred language to French.\
3\) Reload the page, watching the console.

You will see in the console an error message indicating that the video player tried to load the English captions instead of the French ones.

Note that this works properly for Transcripts. The problem is only with captions.
