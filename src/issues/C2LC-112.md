The axe testing tool found this issue: “ARIA hidden element must not contain focusable elements” when “Something went wrong” dialog box is displayed

Steps to reproduce:

* Load the Coding Environment
* Click Connect to Dash
* Click Cancel on the Bluetooth chooser dialog box
* The “Something went wrong” dialog box is displayed
* Run axe

Impact: Serious

<https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/3.4/aria-hidden-focus?application=AxeChrome>

Notes:

* It looks like the Modal that we are using from react-bootstrap is adding a focus listener to ‘document’ which redirects focus back to the Modal, rather than taking other things out of the focus order:
* <https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-overlays/blob/3735169669cb0f53b9a3d616cc13e0604c16eb06/src/Modal.js#L268-L295>
* <https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-overlays/blob/3735169669cb0f53b9a3d616cc13e0604c16eb06/src/Modal.js#L361-L371>
* I wonder if this is a reasonable alternative? Or if we should remove things from the focus order? Either by setting tabindex=-1, disabling, or by removing completely.
