Currently, you can hide the selected action, and still add it to the program even though it's hidden.  Although <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/C2LC-494#icft=C2LC-494> made it possible to manually fix the issue, we agreed to clean things up further:

1. The actions menu should display "Selected" next to the selected action.
2. It should not be possible to hide the selected action.
3. The modal should correctly display the selected command if it's changed using keyboard shortcuts while the modal is open.
