Update the command block styling:

* Use the new icon assets
* Use the new icon colours

Update the blocks in both the command palette and in the program block editor.

For updating the block styling, let's try out using sass to override Bootstrap's default styles (rather than styling with CSS directly). If that is going to be too time-consuming for 0.1, we can use CSS. And switch to sass in the future.

* Create React App documentation on adding sass processing for Bootstrap: <https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-bootstrap/>
* <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/theming/>
* <https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/master/scss>
