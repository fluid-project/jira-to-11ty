We have great examples of the testing we've done.  We want to take our protocols and create templates that others can use to do their testing.  These will be part of the UX Toolkit.  The testing we've done on Fluid can be pointed to as examples (as we've done in several other areas).

The start of this can be found at:  <http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/User+Testing+Resources>, under the Fluid resources section
