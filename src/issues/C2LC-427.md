Steps to reproduce:

* Set Windows to "United States-International" keyboard input
  * Select "ENG INTL" on the taskbar keyboard input method selector
  * If "ENG INTL" is not available, it can be added as follows:
    * Open Settings / Time & Language / Language
    * Click "English (United States)" under "Preferred languages"
    * Click Options
    * Click "Add a keyboard"
    * Add "United States-International"
* Open Weavly in Chrome
* Run Grid 3 and load a Weavly grid set
* Activate the "Actions" cell

Expected:

* Focus to be set to the first Actions block, and then focus to be moved through the Actions Panel

Actual:

* The tabs to move focus and the space to click work, but focus is not set initially to the first Actions block

Other keyboard shortcuts such as Play, Refresh, and Delete All also do not work.
