How would we decide what is in the set of images? Adding images is not the same as choosing from a predefined set of pictograms\n\nAccessibility considerations relating to image use:\n\n* alternative text input for each image\n* record audio which is transcribed to provide alternative text\n* we should encourage authors to provide alternative content, keeping in mind the complexity of the interface\n"
