Steps to reproduce:

1. Tab to a loop counter in the program
2. Type '2A'
3. Tab away

Expected:

The counter should be '2'

Actual:

The counter is '2A'

If you run the program, the counter changes to '2' and behaves as expected.

If you share the program, the counter reads '2' and behaves as expected.
