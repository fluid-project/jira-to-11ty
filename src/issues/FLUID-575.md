During the roadmap meeting.  We assigned next steps to everyone at the meeting:

* add 1-line descriptions for components below the matrix
* look at UX Initiative and identify further component ideas
* double-check cross referencing (identify places where maybe there wasn't an exact match but there is overlap in some part of the functionality or concept)
* add relevance to existing projects
* discuss component ideas on the wiki

I'm estimating 2 hours per design resources for this iteration (Allison, Erin, Eli, Gary, Paul, Daphne)
