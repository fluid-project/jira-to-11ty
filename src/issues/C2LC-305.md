In working on <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/C2LC-290#icft=C2LC-290>, I noticed a warning in the test output.  I was able to track it down to the Interpreter tests.

```java
(node:56482) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality

Expected: 1
Received: 2
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
(node:56482) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Unhandled promise rejection. This error originated either by throwing inside of an async function without a catch block, or by rejecting a promise which was not handled with .catch(). To terminate the node process on unhandled promise rejection, use the CLI flag `--unhandled-rejections=strict` (see https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_unhandled_rejections_mode). (rejection id: 5)
(node:56482) [DEP0018] DeprecationWarning: Unhandled promise rejections are deprecated. In the future, promise rejections that are not handled will terminate the Node.js process with a non-zero exit code.
 PASS  src/Interpreter.test.js
```

Not sure when this was introduced, but [the warning is also there in the tests from the last merge against develop-0.7](https://github.com/codelearncreate/c2lc-coding-environment/runs/1882114520).
