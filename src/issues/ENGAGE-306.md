Styling issues with the exhibitions browse page:

* Some of the list items have rounded edges (duplicate of <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/ENGAGE-304#icft=ENGAGE-304>)
* Text should be vertically centred within a list item
* Thumbnail, height, and type are a bit small: should be 72x72 (appears to be 48x48ish); exhibition title font should be 16 pt bold, date font should be 12 pt regular
* Date format for current exhibitions should be either "Permanent" or "Through \[month day, year]"
