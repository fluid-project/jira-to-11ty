A click event should be passed to the video html element when user clicks on the caption area. Right now height of the overlay div is dynamically changed depending on the height of the captions and therefore in the case when there are > 1 row of captions this div overlaps on top of the captions div. Hence all click are captured by the overlay div not allowing them to pass through to the video element.
