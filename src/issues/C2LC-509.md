We don’t realistically expect an end user to use the shortcuts, at least as they are currently implemented. In the future we could rework the keyboard shortcuts, for example by providing a UI to enable/disable each shortcut and/or customize the key for each shortcut. Also realistically, if someone is using another AT (such as a screen reader) that has their own shortcuts, they are probably best to disable the Weavly shortcuts so that they don’t clash.\n\nClosing this issue.\n"

There are several shortcuts starting with (crtl)alt+x followed by up to three characters typed in one at a time. It might help if there is a visual indicator when you move into this mode. This might help with cases where the input is blocked (example typing a letter into the position input), for tracking if the mode is still active, and what has been entered already. I’m not familiar with the keystrokes so I’m fumbling through them. I’m sure this will get easier with experience, but I’m fumbling a bit right now, and not sure how fast I have to try to type everything in for it to work. 

 

A visual indicator I’m thinking of might just show the keystrokes being entered (after alt-x) is typed, or maybe the command name.

 

Alt + x, c, t, l

 

Alt+x

c: Character

t: Turn

l: Left

 

Alt + x, f, s  

 

Alt+x

f: Focus

s: Scene

 

This could also be useful in cases where the keyboard shortcuts are used by an AT and imputed on behalf of the user. In this way they can confirm that the action they are requesting is performing the action they expect. Especially in cases where nothing appears to happen. E.g. trying to move back when in column 1.
