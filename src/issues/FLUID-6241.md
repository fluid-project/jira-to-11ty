As part of recent work on the icons used in Infusion, and specifically UIO, a visual style guide was created. <https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Infusion+Icons+Visual+Style+Guide>. Our current icons were also updated to adhere to the new style guide. These should be exported to the Infusion-Icons repos as SVGs for use in the various projects.
