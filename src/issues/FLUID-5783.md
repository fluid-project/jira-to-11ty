I've found at least two tutorial pages that deal with self-contained, independent, Infusion-wide topics that are nonetheless contained within a folder related to a different topic:

1\) The Icon Fonts tutorial is inside the folder related to creating adjusters, but I think it would be helpful for everyone.

2\) The String Templates tutorial is in its own folder, but in the left sidebar table of contents, it's listed in with the Prefs Framework pages.

I think these tutorials will be easier for people to find if they're organized more appropriately
