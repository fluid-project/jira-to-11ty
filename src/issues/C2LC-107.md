So, another perspective on running an empty program would be that it executes all of the empty blocks, pausing for a time on each one.\n\nAre empty blocks within a program different from emtpry blocks at the end? For example, the following program:\n\n* Forward, empty, empty, Forward, empty, empty\n"

We need to determine whether we should allow people to run an empty program. If not, then we should grey out and disable the run button when the program is empty.
