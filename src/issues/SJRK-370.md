Update the version of Infusion used by the Storytelling Tool to the latest release in the <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-6145#icft=FLUID-6145> branch line, or whatever "full" release incorporates it.

This will solve <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/FLUID-6512#icft=FLUID-6512> in the Storytelling Tool as well as open up the possibility of dealing with a number of other issues.
