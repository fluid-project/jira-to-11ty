Scrolling to the active program step scrolls the whole page, not just the program editor. This is particularly visible when using the scene.

To reproduce:

* Adjust your browser window such that it is possible to view the scene without the program editor
* Make a program in the program editor
* Run the program
* Scroll up to the scene, with the program editor off screen

Expected:

* The scene remains visible while the program is running

Actual:

* On the next program step, the page will scroll down to the program editor

We want the program editor to scroll horizontally to show the active program step, but we don't want the page to be scrolled.

We are currently using `Element.scrollIntoView()`: <https://github.com/codelearncreate/c2lc-coding-environment/blob/bf653cc9526e9d8013383f07e8fc5b8689b12ffa/src/ProgramBlockEditor.js#L466>

* <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView>
* <https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom-view/#dom-element-scrollintoview>

We may be able to change how we are using `Element.scrollIntoView()` or we may need to switch to another mechanism to scroll, such as calculating the position of the active program step within the editor and using `Element.scrollLeft` on the program editor scroll container.
