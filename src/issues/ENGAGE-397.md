All thumbnail images serving as links need link labels. Currently every thumbnail image relating to an exhibition or artifact is just announced as 'link' and the user has no clue where the link leads.&#x20;

in the grid view there is no information about where each image link leads. So the label is critical there.

In the list view, the image is followed by a text link but without visual cue of juxtaposition, it is difficult to know which text associates with which image.

In the Exhibition view under the Catalogue, the texts following the thumbnails are not links. Link labels for the thumbnail images again become critical here.
