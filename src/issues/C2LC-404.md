On Safari, the character does not rotate within the character positioning control panel.

The character does rotate within the Scene on Safari.

To rotate within the Scene, we enclose the character within a `<g>` element and apply the `transform` to that element. Whereas for the character positioning panel, we are placing a `transform` attribute directly on the character SVG, which Safari does not support.
