Observed when using Weavly with NVDA on Windows 10 with Firefox and Chrome: the theme selector menu items are not highlighted.

Steps to reproduce:

* Run NVDA
* Tab to move focus to the Theme selector
* Press Enter to open the menu
* Use cursor keys to move within the menu

Expected:

* The current menu item to be highlighted (which one has focus)

Actual:

* There is no focus or other active menu item visual indication

Update: I can get focus highlighting on the Theme selector if I switch NVDA into forms mode (NVDA-space). So I think that this issue is likely a side effect of the ARIA markup not quite being correct. See C2LC-369
