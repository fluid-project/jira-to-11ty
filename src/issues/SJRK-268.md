Set up a version of the Storytelling Tool to gather stories related to urban co-design.

Title: Co-designing Inclusive Cities\
URL: <https://stories.cities.inclusivedesign.ca/>

This version of the site will use the same colour scheme as the current Cities website (<https://cities.inclusivedesign.ca/>), with the dark grey and blue replacing the orange and blue, respecitvely. The site will consist only of the Edit and Browse pages, and the "sandbox mode" note on the Edit page will be removed.

Once ready, CI jobs should be set up to host the site from the following yet-to-be-created GitHub branch, along with any required Docker containers:\
<https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/tree/stories-cities-production>

Editing should be disabled for now, then edited on September 9th, 2019 and turned off once more after stories are gathered on September 12, 2019.
