This is a time-boxed activity to get this persona as far into the new persona format (<http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Persona+Format>) as possible. After this persona is in the new format, a priority will be to move information from the narrative section on page 1 into a categorized, bulleted section on page 2. This second page should contain information that is sort of an Appendix" to page 1 with information that is helpful, but not central to understanding this persona's story.
