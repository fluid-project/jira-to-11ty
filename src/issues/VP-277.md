When you use the keyboard to get focus on the video player and then try to start the video, the video does not start. Steps to reproduce:

1\. load the video player and tab until the video player gets focus\
2\. press space\
Notice that the video does not start even though the play overlay disappears. \
3\. press space again\
Notice that the video starts but the play overlay reappears.&#x20;
