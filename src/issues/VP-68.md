When scrubbing the scrubber bar, the transcript is slow to scroll to catch up.

To reproduce:

* Open <http://build.fluidproject.org/videoPlayer/videoPlayer/demos/VideoPlayer.html>
* Reveal transcripts
* Using keyboard, focus on the scrub thumb
* Note: Do not play the video
* press and hold the right arrow key for 2 seconds and then release
* notice that the transcript initially scrolls quickly, but then slows down and eventually catches up to the proper time.
