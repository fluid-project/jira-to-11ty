After uploading an image using IE7, it displays under the resources section of both IE7 and Firefox. However, neither of them display the new image in the gallery.  When the image is uploaded using firefox, into the same folder, the image is now displayed in the gallery and viewable by both IE7 and Firefox.&#x20;
