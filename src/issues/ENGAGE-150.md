The wireframes for this task are available here:

As part of the MyCollection feature of Engage, we need to create a generic Image Grid view that displays a grid of small thumbnail images suitable for use on a small mobile screen. We will want to take some inspiration from the markup and stylesheets we created for the Image Reorderer demo, available here:

<http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/reorderer/imageReorderer/demo.html>
