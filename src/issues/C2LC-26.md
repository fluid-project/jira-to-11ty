Set up a convenient method of hosting in-development c2lc-coding-environment work. For easy sharing of experiments and work that isn't ready for production yet.

Ideally, on each commit:

* The project is built and tested (as now)
* If the build is successful, it is deployed to a static web host
  * Each personal repo and each branch are hosted independently

For example, at a URL like:

```java
https://c2lc-testing.somehost.com/simonbates/C2LC-19/
```

Some options:

* Firebase
  * <https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-action-for-firebase>
* GitHub Pages
  * <https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-pages-deploy>
  * <https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-pages-action>
  * <https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-github-pages>
* Netlify
  * <https://github.com/netlify/actions>
