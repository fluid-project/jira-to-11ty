In IE8, focus on the video player container would sometimes activate the UIO panel instead.&#x20;

To reproduce:

1\. Load the demo in IE8\
2\. Tab through the demo once completely.\
3\. Tab (carefully) until focus appears on the video player (note the dotted outline on the container)\
4\. Press Space / Enter.\
5\. Notice that the UIO panel activates instead.
