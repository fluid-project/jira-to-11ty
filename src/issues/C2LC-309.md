\`npx csslint src\` run against develop-0.7 reveals a bunch of style issues we don't particular care about, but a few actual problems, notably trying to set the same property twice:

```java
csslint: There are 9 problems in /Users/duhrer/Source/rtf/c2lc-coding-environment/src/ConfirmDeleteAllModal.css.

...

ConfirmDeleteAllModal.css
7: warning at line 31, col 5
Duplicate property 'grid-row-start' found.
    grid-row-start: 2;

ConfirmDeleteAllModal.css
8: warning at line 32, col 5
Duplicate property 'grid-row-end' found.
    grid-row-end: 3;
```

I can run this manually against my theming work for now and clean up the strays, but this seems like an easy thing to add.

We'd have to adjust some of the settings, for example, although I find it terribly useful to alphabetise properties, I don't know that we want to use that default.  I'd be happy just to check for duplicates for now.
