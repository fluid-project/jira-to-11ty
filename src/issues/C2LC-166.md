Sphero moves with respect to a fixed external frame of reference, rather than relative to its current heading. When Sphero is instructed to move at a certain angle, the direction is always relative to the space that Sphero is in (for example, 0 degrees is always the front of the room), and is independent of the movements that have been made previously.

Sphero's shell rotates around its inner core and, unlike other robots, you cannot pick a Sphero up and rotate it to change it's orientation. When you pick a Sphero up and rotate it, the inner core remains aligned to the space it is in, while the outer shell rotates around it.

We will need to provide a UI to align Sphero's frame of reference with that desired by the user of the coding environment.

In the software provided by Sphero, the alignment is done by putting Sphero into an 'alignment mode' where LEDs light up to show you its 0 degrees direction, and a user interface that lets you change Sphero's orientation by dragging a dot around a circle.
