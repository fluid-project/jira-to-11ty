The final wireframes call for a large overlay to be briefly displayed whenever captions are turned on or off:

<http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Video+Player+wireframes>

This overlay confirms the successful change in caption state, since the pop-up menu disappears when the user activates a caption (or turns them off).

Note that this functionality will apply audio descriptions as well as captions. It will NOT happen with transcripts, since there is already visual confirmation of any changes (since the transcript window itself appears and disappears).
