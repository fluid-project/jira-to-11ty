When using a bluetooth keyboard with an iOS device, various elements are not focusable via tab navigation, including:

1. The program sequence
2. command blocks within the actions menu
3. the refresh icon
4. the delete icon
5. the world selector
6. the theme picker
7. play controls

You can use the new shortcuts to focus on the first element in unreachable areas like the program sequence, but the next tab (or shift+tab) takes you away.  This doesn’t seem to be a new issue, create.weavly.org has the same issues.

The issue is also reproducible with the iOS simulator in OS X.
