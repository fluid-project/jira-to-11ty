Is the masters program mentioned anywhere else on the IDI site?\n\nFor the format of the masters students page itself, I think the same format as the people page makes sense for now (we would probably have to revisit it once the list gets longer). But maybe instead of the items on the right panel, just a link back to the people page.\n"

Jutta would like to include bios of graduates of the MDes program to the IDI site, touting them as HQPs ("highly qualified personnel"). She suggests this should be a separate page from the current People page.
