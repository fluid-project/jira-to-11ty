Choose a theme, click on a button - while it's being hovered over and is active, the button appears blank. Volume button always appears blank when active I think because it doesn't have a hover image change, whereas the others do. It seems we don't have those images themed yet, or they're possibly backwards, so the background and image are the same colour.
