Occasionally, some of the VideoPlayer integration tests fail (e.g. VideoPlayerIntegration-test.html, VideoPlayerTranscriptIntegration-test.html, VIdeoPlayerIntervalEventsConductorIntegration-test.html). It's not clear why they fail, though we suspect it might be a timing issue. We may need to take a closer look at how the tests are structured, what events are being used to trigger the tests, etc.

To reproduce, open the all-tests.html file, and keep reloading until some of the tests fail.
