Last Thursday, Sidewalk Labs announced a partnership with OCAD University to look at accessibility of the Quayside project. We should provide a post on the Inclusive Cities website that shares our perspectives and ideas on what this partnership could involve, and invites others to share their thoughts.

This task will require the introduction of a new "Ideas in Progress" section of the site.
