All of the JavaScript files ( excluding third party dependencies ) should be reviewed to ensure that the copyrights are correct. If there are any errors, these should be addressed. This includes both source, demos, examples, test, and etc.

Can make use of GitHub's Blame and History views to examine the source files.&#x20;
