In <https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/browse/C2LC-287#icft=C2LC-287>, we discussed the limitations of using an HTML range input for the speed slider, namely that we cannot achieve the full styles outlined in the new design.

With an HTML range input, the closest we can get is a squared off look, like this:
