The Infusion Builder QA test plan is located here in the wiki:

<http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Infusion+Builder+QA+Test+Plan>

There are several links that point to old deployments of the Builder. Let's update this page to link to the awesome new Infusion Builder daily build instance, which is located here:
