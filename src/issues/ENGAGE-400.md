When the app is used with French option, the page titles do not appear in French.&#x20;

The page titles are the first thing a VoiceOver user hears during transitions and they provide a clue about what is coming up. So they are important.&#x20;

While most of the current page titles match well with the screen titles, the following changes will improve the experience:

1\. There are two pages named Browse. They could be renamed 'Browse Exhibitions' and 'Browse Artifacts'.\
2\. The name Home occurs for both the Language Selection page and the Home page. The former could be renamed to 'Language Selection' page.
