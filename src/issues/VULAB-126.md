I got some great feedback from the list including a reference to LimeSurvey (<http://www.limesurvey.org/content/view/16/31/lang,en/>) and Zoomerang (<http://zoomerangdemos.com/faq_images/qtypes.html>) from Allison, which I need to research.

Also, Daphne suggested gathering internet connection information as well as any assistive technologies, great idea!

I will re-list this research after I bring it all together in a re-factored report.
