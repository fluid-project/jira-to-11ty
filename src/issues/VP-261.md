Currently the transcripts determine how to find the time in the transcripts through an if else block. This could be an issue if there are other formats of transcripts that we have to support in the future. It would probably be better to expose a common interface for determining the time. As for how the time is actually parsed from the transcript, we could think of something like demands blocks, invokers, and/or having each component be a separate component that handles that type.&#x20;
