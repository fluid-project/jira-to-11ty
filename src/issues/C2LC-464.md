At the moment, only Michelle's iPad is the one with problem, but saw a few posts on Google that some people experience the same flickering issues with CSS animations.

The issue was also there in the 0.7 version of Weavly however it wasn't happening as often.

The issue is related to using CSS animations however we aren't sure what the specific cause is. When the animation is on a simple demo page (non React) it works fine without flickering.
