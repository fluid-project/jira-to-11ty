Several issues were encountered in the user testing of the layout customizer.  It is not initially clear whether these issues are with the layout customizer, with uPortal, or with the integration.  We need to have a discussion to sort it out and see if there are enhancements and fixes needed for the layout customizer and/or additional documentation needed on integrating the component.
