Mockup images, used to show unimplemented features, needed to have  1px padding, or will break the cabinet&#x20;

If the padding wasn't added the cabinet would initialize but you wouldn't be able to open the drawer to show the full image. It would display only a thin sliver of the image and would close immediately after being openned.
