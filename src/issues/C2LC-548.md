The Delete Program dialog announcement is "delete all movements?" whereas the text reads "Are you sure you want to delete all steps of your program?"

* We use "movement" in other announcements also: when we add a step and when we delete a step
* Options to make more consistent:
  * "delete all steps?"
  * "Are you sure you want to delete all steps of your program?"
* How does this interact with the preview announce on focus work?
